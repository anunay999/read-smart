# ðŸš€ Getting Started with Read Smart

Welcome to **Read Smart**! This guide walks you from zero to personalised reading bliss in just a few minutes.

---

## 1. What Is Read Smart?

Read Smart is a browser extension that:

1. Extracts the main text of any article.
2. Looks at what you've already read (your private "memory").
3. Asks Google's Gemini model to rewrite the article so it focuses on *new* information for you.
4. Displays the personalised version in a beautiful reader view.

Everything happens on your machine or with services you directly control. No hidden servers, no surprise data sales.

## 2. Prerequisites

| Service | Why We Need It | How It's Used |
|---------|---------------|---------------|
| **Gemini API Key** | Large-language-model that performs the rewriting. | We send a prompt + article text and receive the rephrased Markdown. |
| **Mem0 API Key** | Secure, personal memory vault. | Stores short memory snippets (3-4 lines each) and lets the extension search them for relevance. |

Both keys are *optional*â€”but without them you'll miss out on the personalised magic. Reader Mode will still work.

## 7. Privacy & Security

â€¢ **Local-first** â€“ The extension has *no* backend. Text extraction, caching, and rendering all happen in your browser.

â€¢ **You control external calls** â€“ The only outbound requests are:
  - To Gemini: your article text + prompt â†’ rephrased article.
  - To Mem0: memory snippets you *explicitly* choose to store.

â€¢ **Delete at any time** â€“ Clear the extension's storage via *Chrome â†’ Settings â†’ Privacy â†’ Clear browsing data â†’ Hosted app data*.

## 8. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| "Gemini API key not set" error | Key missing or wrong | Double-check in Settings; make sure it has *generation* permission. |
| Article says "Could not extract content" | Highly dynamic or pay-walled site | Use the *Reader Mode* first, or copy-paste text into a new tab. |
| Personalisation feels off | Few or no memories stored | Click *Add to Memory* on background articles you already understand. |
