# üß† Read Smart ‚Äì Turn the Web into Your Personal Editor

**Read Smart** is a Chrome extension that instantly rewrites any long-form article in light of *your* existing knowledge. It remembers what you have read, surfaces the right background when you need it, and lets you learn twice as fast without information overload.

## ‚ú® Why You'll Love It

‚Ä¢ **Personalised Summaries** ‚Äì Articles are rephrased to skip what you already know and focus on what's new for *you*.

‚Ä¢ **Knowledge Connections** ‚Äì Inline call-outs show *why* a section matters based on your past reading.

‚Ä¢ **Author's Voice Preserved** ‚Äì We re-write, not butcher. The tone, humour, and flow stay intact.

‚Ä¢ **Zero-Distraction Reader Mode** ‚Äì Beautiful, single-scroll page with warm typography and no ads.

‚Ä¢ **Privacy First** ‚Äì All memories live on your own machine or in your own Mem0 account; nothing is ever sent to our servers.

## üõ°Ô∏è Your Data, Your Rules

‚Ä¢ **No Cloud Backend** ‚Äì The extension ships without a server. All processing happens locally or directly with Gemini/Mem0 via keys *you* own.

‚Ä¢ **Selective Storage** ‚Äì Only the minimal text needed to create memories is stored. Full articles are never uploaded.

‚Ä¢ **Easy Opt-Out** ‚Äì Pause memory capture at any time; wipe the local cache with one click.
